###firefox UI mods/for Linux

A bunch of styles, mostly to accompany gtk themes, that started out as a mod of [this](https://github.com/lassekongo83/zuki-themes/blob/master/Zukitre-firefox-theme/chrome/userChrome.css) 

All have these changes in common:

- reduced padding around awesomebar
- reduced margin left and right on tabbar
- removed rounded back-forward button bg
- restored separators between tabs/pinned tabs
- removed separator between settings icon and rest of toolbar

Used via Stylish on top of the default Firefox (30, 31) theme
Running fine on Ubuntu 14.04
Each style has a screenshot included
