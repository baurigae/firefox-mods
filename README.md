###firefox UI mods/for Linux

(2016 update: I've since figured out GitHub (kinda.. :) and now my stylesheets can be found in [Gists](https://gist.github.com/baurigae))

_And now - back to our regularly scheduled programming - in another time - previously, on baurigae's Firefox UI mods!.._

A bunch of styles, mostly to accompany gtk themes, that started out as a mod of [this](https://github.com/lassekongo83/zuki-themes/blob/master/Zukitre-firefox-theme/chrome/userChrome.css) 

All have these changes in common:

- reduced padding around awesomebar
- reduced margin left and right on tabbar
- removed rounded back-forward button bg
- restored separators between tabs/pinned tabs
- removed separator between settings icon and rest of toolbar

Used via Stylish on top of the default Firefox (30-37) theme

Running fine on Ubuntu 14.04

Each style has a screenshot included
