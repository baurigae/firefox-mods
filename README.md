###firefox UI mods

######_menakalinan_
WIP to make [this](https://github.com/lassekongo83/zuki-themes/blob/master/Zukitre-firefox-theme/chrome/userChrome.css) suit me better

So far:

- reduced padding around awesomebar
- reduced margin left and right on tabbar
- removed rounded back-forward button bg
- restored separators between tabs/pinned tabs
- removed separator between settings icon and rest of toolbar

Further mod to make the style match my [Moskva GTK/Unity theme](https://github.com/baurigae/moskva) color-scheme-wise, and also by removing shadows

_I use these with the default theme, as styles via Stylish - Firefox 30 running on Ubuntu 14.04._
